## Problem Statement
Small businesses rely on pop-up shops for growth but face numerous challenges:

- Scattered Research: Finding events across multiple platforms and social media is inefficient.
- Repetitive Applications: Vendors waste time re-entering the same information repeatedly.
- Unreliable Organizers: Lack of vetting leads to unprofessional events and financial risk.
- Tracking Difficulties: Vendors manually track their applications and schedules, increasing disorganization.
- Financial Uncertainty: Determining whether an event is profitable is often unclear.

## Key Features
1. Centralized Event Discovery: Web scraping and APIs to aggregate upcoming pop-up shops, filtered by relevance (location, vendor type, fees, etc.).
2. Streamlined Applications: Pre-saved vendor profiles to reduce repetitive form-filling.
3. Community Ratings: A vendor-driven rating and review system for organizers and events.
4. Financial Tools: Calculate event profitability by weighing fees, travel costs, and expected sales.
5. Integrated Scheduling: Track approved, denied, and pending applications, with calendar synchronization.
6. Vendor Networking: Build connections and share insights through community features.
